To return the sum of three numbers in JavaScript, you can create a function that takes three parameters and returns their sum. Here is a simple example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum(a, b, c) {\n    return a + b + c;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function Declaration**: The function `sum` is declared using the `function` keyword.\n- **Parameters**: It takes three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the numbers to be summed.\n- **Return Statement**: The function returns the result of adding these three numbers using the `+` operator.\n- **Usage**: You can call this function with three numbers as arguments, like so: `sum(1, 2, 3);`. This will return `6`. This approach allows you to easily compute the sum of any three numbers you provide as input.
